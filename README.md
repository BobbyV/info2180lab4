The theme of this lab is that we'll be writing a page with a simple "maze" that the user must navigate with the mouse. The difficulty is not in finding the exit, because the maze is trivial, but rather in having the dexterity to move the mouse through the maze without touching any of the walls. When the user's mouse cursor touches one of the maze walls, the walls turn red and a "You lose" message is shown. Touching the Start button with the mouse will remove the red coloring from the maze walls.
